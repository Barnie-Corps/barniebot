BarnieBot Privacy Policy

# Privacy Policy

## 1. Introduction

We are committed to respecting and protecting the privacy of all users who interact with our Discord bot, BarnieBot. This Privacy Policy outlines the types of information we collect, how we use it, and the measures we take to secure it.

## 2. Information We Collect

We collect the following public data from Discord:

- Profile picture
- Username
- Discord ID
- Command executions (both count and complete log)

We also store messages, including their [encrypted] content, when they're sent through the bot's global chat for security purposes. This information cannot be deleted. Additionally, we collect public guild info and bot interaction statistics. When using our AI feature, we store the chat history so you can continue the conversation later, but this data is not shared with any third parties, you can delete it at any time and, in case that data passes the 60,000 characters limit, it will be automatically deleted. We also store the user's language preference, which can be changed at any time. We do not store any other personal information. We do not store any payment information, as we do not offer any paid services yet. Once any deletable data is deleted, it is permanently removed from our servers and cannot be recovered.

## 3. Use of Information

The information we collect is used to improve the functionality of BarnieBot and enhance user experience. We do not share or sell your information to any third parties. We may use your information to:
- Provide you with the services you request
- Personalize your experience
- Improve our services
- Respond to your inquiries
Also, some public data as your username can be displayed in some features like the messages top command, but we do not store any other personal information. We may also use your information to contact you with important updates or information about our services. We will not send you any promotional or marketing emails. We may also use your information to investigate and prevent fraud, abuse, or other illegal activities. We may also use your information to comply with applicable laws, regulations, or legal processes.

## 4. Security

We implement a variety of security measures to maintain the safety of your personal information. We are committed to protecting your information to the best of our ability. If necessary, our dev(s) can join your guild through a staff command that generates an invitation to your server. We do not share it with non-staffs.

## 5. Changes to This Policy

We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. We advise you to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes, as continued use of BarnieBot constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.
