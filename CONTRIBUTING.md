## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

```

4. Configure your development environment:

### Important Notes
- Never remove the `global.ReadbleStream = require('web-streams-polyfill').ReadableStream;` line from `index.ts`
- Replace the comment header in `index.ts` with content from `based.txt`
- Use `ts-node` for development to speed up testing
