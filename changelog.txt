[!] Tags:
 - ALPHA: It's in early usage, which means it's not completely done and bugs are expected.
 - DEV: It's meant for developers and normal users should just ignore them.
 - BETA: It's completely done but there are still bugs that are being fixed.

[/] Changes:
  - Updated ReplyFunction interface [DEV]

[+] New:
 - Added social category
 - Added Global Chats function (b.command gchat) [ALPHA]

[-] Removed:

This is the first changelog note, this file will contain all changelogs from V 3.1.7, if it becomes too large (that surely will happen), changelogs will be published on single files as releases in github.
